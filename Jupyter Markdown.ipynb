    "## <a name=\"getting-started\"></a>Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the 'jupyter' package:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a notebook in jupyter:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"overview\"></a>Markdown Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that Markdown is a *very simple* markup language that captures the essence of your document structure in a human-readable form. There is a direct translation from the constructs in your text file to the HTML that will be generated to display it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common syntax elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Just type on a line. One or more empty lines between non-empty lines demarks paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the line with one to six `#` characters to turn that line into a heading; one is the biggest, six is the smallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a single `*` character before and after the text you want italicized: `*hi*` becomes *hi*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use two consecutive `*` characters before and after the text you want boldfaced: `**pow**` becomes **pow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bulleted lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the line with a `*` or a `-` character to make the line a bullet item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indent the line with two spaces before the `*` to make a sub-item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * this is the main-item\n",
    "      * this is the sub item\n",
    "    * this is the next main item\n",
    "\n",
    "... becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* this is the main-item\n",
    "  * this is the sub item\n",
    "* this is the next main item\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbered lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as bulleted, but start the line with `1.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indent the same way: precede the line with two spaces to make a sub-item (`__1.` becomes 1.a... those underlines represent spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers don't matter, the actual numbers will be calculated when the list is rendered. I just use `1.` for each item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. this is the main-item\n",
    "    1. this is the next main item\n",
    "\n",
    "... becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. this is the main-item\n",
    "1. this is the next main item\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have bullets inside a numbered list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. this is the main item\n",
    "      * this is a bullet under the main item\n",
    "    1. this is the next main item\n",
    "\n",
    "... becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. this is the main item\n",
    "  * this is a bullet under the main item\n",
    "1. this is the next main item\n",
    "\n",
    "### Links\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap the text you want linked with `[` and `]`, and immediately follow it with the URL wrapped in `(` and `)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following markdown `[Google](http://google.com)` will turn into this link: [Google](http://google.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codeblocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Code can be represented inline or stand-alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inline:** For a small number of words inline, wrap them in `` ` `` characters: `` `print 'hello world'` `` turns into this: `print 'hello world'` (note that it's just part of the paragraph).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stand-alone:** To show several consecutive lines of code, just start each line with four or more spaces; the first four spaces indicate it is part of the block and the remainder are used for furtner indentation in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in x:\n",
    "        print 'i:', i\n",
    "\n",
    "### Horizontal rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Just put three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underlines on a line by themselves, such as `---`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a table, just draw the table boundaries using `|` and `-` characters. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | This | is    |\n",
    "    |------|-------|\n",
    "    |   a  | table |\n",
    "\n",
    "... becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| This | is    |\n",
    "|------|-------|\n",
    "|   a  | table |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The table boundaries don't have to be aligned (just make sure your horizontal dividers are at least 3 characters long). You could get the same effect as above by using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | This | is |\n",
    "    |------|---|\n",
    "    | a |table         |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "You can insert HTML anywhere in your Markdown and it will be passed through as-is to the renderer. For instance, `<strong>pow</strong>` becomes <strong>pow</strong>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"jupyter-specific\"></a>Jupyter Extensions for Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "*Jupyter*'s engine allows you to embed some non-standard Markdown syntax.:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline code:\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't really a *Markdown* thing, this is a *Jupyter* thing. Just put Python expressions in separate notebook blocks, between Markdown blocks. In this way you can alternate between text and running/live code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LaTeX expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can embed LaTeX equations both inline and as stand-alone text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inline:** To embed inline, surround the LaTeX expression with `$` characters. For example, `$e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$` becomes $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stand-alone:** Expressions can also be moved to a line by themselves by wrapping them in `$$` characters (two `$` characters at each end of the expression) and placing them on a line by themselves. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$e^x=\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i!}x^i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "... becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^x=\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i!}x^i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### File references\n",
    "\n",
    "You can include references to local files to be rendered as images or otherwise served via your Markdown document:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <img src=\"../images/python_logo.svg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"other\"></a>All the Rest\n",
    "\n",
    "See the resources for more detail on each of these and the more complicated structures you might want to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"notes\"></a>Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* R Markdown does not support smileys. You'll have to handle those in a different way. :)\n",
